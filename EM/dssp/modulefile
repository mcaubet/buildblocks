The DSSP program was designed by Wolfgang Kabsch and Chris Sander to
standardize secondary structure assignment. DSSP is a database of secondary
structure assignments (and much more) for all protein entries in the Protein
Data Bank (PDB). DSSP is also the program that calculates DSSP entries from PDB
entries. DSSP does not predict secondary structure.
