module-help             "EMAN2 is a broadly based greyscale scientific image processing suite with a primary focus on processing data from transmission electron microscopes. EMAN's original purpose was performing single particle reconstructions (3-D volumetric models from 2-D cryo-EM images) at the highest possible resolution, but the suite now also offers support for single particle cryo-ET, and tools useful in many other subdisciplines such as helical reconstruction, 2-D crystallography and whole-cell tomography. EMAN2 is capable of processing large data sets (>100,000 particle) very efficiently.

Please also note that this is not the (related) EMEN2 electronic notebook, but is EMAN2, a scientific image processing suite.
