# IsoNet

A deep learning-based software package that iteratively reconstructs the missing-wedge information and increases signal-to-noise ratio, using the knowledge learned from raw tomograms. Without the need for sub-tomogram averaging, IsoNet generates tomograms with significantly reduced resolution anisotropy.
