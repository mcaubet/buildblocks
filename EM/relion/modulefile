RELION (for REgularised LIkelihood OptimisatioN, pronounce rely-on) is a
stand-alone computer program that employs an empirical Bayesian approach to
refinement of (multiple) 3D reconstructions or 2D class averages in electron
cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). It is developed in the group of Sjors Scheres at the
MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Briefly, the ill-posed problem of
3D-reconstruction is regularised by incorporating prior knowledge: the fact
that macromolecular structures are smooth, i.e. they have limited power in the
Fourier domain. In the corresponding Bayesian framework, many parameters of a
statistical model are learned from the data, which leads to objective and
high-quality results without the need for user expertise. The underlying theory
is given in Scheres (2012) JMB. A more detailed description of its
implementation is given in Scheres (2012) JSB. If RELION is useful in your
work, please cite at least one of these papers.
