Bash is the GNU Project's shell. Bash is the Bourne Again SHell. Bash is
an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn
shell (ksh) and C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE
POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional
improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition,
most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.

The improvements offered by Bash include:

 -  Command line editing
 -  Unlimited size command history
 -  Job Control
 -  Shell Functions and Aliases
 -  Indexed arrays of unlimited size
 -  Integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four
