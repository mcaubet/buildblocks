Fstress is a synthetic, flexible, self-scaling NFS file service benchmark
whose primary goal is flexibility. Fstress exports control over several
dimensions in both data set and workload, enabling a wide range of tests
for fundamental evaluation of file service scalability, sizing, 
configuration, and other factors. Fstress includes several important
canned workloads.
