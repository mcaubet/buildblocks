VMD is designed for modeling, visualization, and analysis of biological systems
such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipid bilayer assemblies, etc. It may be used
to view more general molecules, as VMD can read standard Protein Data Bank
(PDB) files and display the contained structure. VMD provides a wide variety of
methods for rendering and coloring a molecule: simple points and lines, CPK
spheres and cylinders, licorice bonds, backbone tubes and ribbons, cartoon
drawings, and others. VMD can be used to animate and analyze the trajectory of
a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In particular, VMD can act as a graphical
front end for an external MD program by displaying and animating a molecule
undergoing simulation on a remote computer.
