Eclipse is famous for its Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE), but
its C/C++ IDE and PHP IDE are pretty cool too. You can easily combine
language support and other features into any of our default packages, and
the Eclipse Marketplace allows for virtually unlimited customization and
extension.
