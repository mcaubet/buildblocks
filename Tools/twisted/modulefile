module-help "
Twisted is an event-driven network programming framework written in Python and
licensed under the MIT License. Twisted projects variously support TCP, UDP,
SSL/TLS, IP multicast, Unix domain sockets, many protocols (including HTTP,
XMPP, NNTP, IMAP, SSH, IRC, FTP, and others), and much more. Twisted is based
on the event-driven programming paradigm, which means that users of Twisted
write short callbacks which are called by the framework.
