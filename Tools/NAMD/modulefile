NAMD is a high-performance molecular dynamics (MD) software for simulating
large biological systems, like proteins and viruses, on parallel computers,
renowned for its efficiency in handling millions of atoms by using
parallelization and the Charm++ programming model to scale across many
processors, often integrated with visualization tools like VMD for interactive
analysis of atomic movements over time.
