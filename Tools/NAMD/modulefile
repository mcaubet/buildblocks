module-help		"NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance
simulation of large biomolecular systems. Based on Charm++ parallel objects,
NAMD scales to hundreds of cores for typical simulations and beyond 500,000
cores for the largest simulations. NAMD uses the popular molecular graphics
program VMD for simulation setup and trajectory analysis, but is also
file-compatible with AMBER, CHARMM, and X-PLOR.
