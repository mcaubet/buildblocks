Autoconf is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell scripts
to automatically configure software source code packages. These scripts
can adapt the packages to many kinds of UNIX-like systems without manual
user intervention. Autoconf creates a configuration script for a package
from a template file that lists the operating system features that the
package can use, in the form of M4 macro calls.
