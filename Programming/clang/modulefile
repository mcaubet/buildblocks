Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to
deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning
messages and to provide a platform for building great source level
tools. The Clang Static Analyzer and clang-tidy are tools that
automatically find bugs in your code, and are great examples of the
sort of tools that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library
to parse C/C++ code.
