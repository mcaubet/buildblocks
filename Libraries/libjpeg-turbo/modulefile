module-help "
libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions to accelerate
baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, Arm, PowerPC, and
MIPS systems, as well as progressive JPEG compression on x86, x86-64, and Arm
systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg,
all else being equal. On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still
outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized
Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals
that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.
