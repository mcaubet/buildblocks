The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) provides audio and MIDI
functionality to the Linux operating system. ALSA has the following
significant features:
o Efficient support for all types of audio interfaces, from consumer
  sound cards to professional multichannel audio interfaces.
o Fully modularized sound drivers.
o SMP and thread-safe design.
o User space library (alsa-lib) to simplify application programming
  and provide higher level functionality.
o Support for the older Open Sound System (OSS) API, providing
  binary compatibility for most OSS programs.
