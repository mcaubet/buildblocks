ZeroMQ looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a
concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry atomic messages
across various transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP, and
multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fan-out,
pub-sub, task distribution, and request-reply. It's fast enough to be
the fabric for clustered products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you
scalable multicore applications, built as asynchronous message-processing
tasks. It has a score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems.
