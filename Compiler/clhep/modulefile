The CLHEP project was proposed by Leif Lönnblad at CHEP 92. It is intended
to be a set of HEP-specific foundation and utility classes such as random
generators, physics vectors, geometry and linear algebra. CLHEP is structured
in a set of packages independent of any external package (interdependencies
within CLHEP are allowed under certain conditions).
