Kokkos Core implements a programming model in C++ for writing performance
portable applications targeting all major HPC platforms. For that purpose
it provides abstractions for both parallel execution of code and data 
management. Kokkos is designed to target complex node architectures with
N-level memory hierarchies and multiple types of execution resources. It
currently can use CUDA, HPX, OpenMP and Pthreads as backend programming 
models with several other backends in development.
