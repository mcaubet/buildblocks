Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax
and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it
an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development
in many areas on most platforms.
