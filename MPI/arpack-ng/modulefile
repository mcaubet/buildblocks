This project started as a joint project between Debian, Octave and Scilab
in order to provide a common and maintained version of arpack. This is now
a community project maintained by a few volunteers. Indeed, no single release
has been published by Rice university for the last few years and since many
software (Octave, Scilab, R, Matlab...) forked it and implemented their own
modifications, arpack-ng aims to tackle this by providing a common repository,
maintained versions with a testsuite. arpack-ng is replacing arpack almost
everywhere.
